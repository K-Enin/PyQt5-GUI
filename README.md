# Sorting Pictures with PyQt5
This program creates a GUI where pictures and dropdown-menus are displayed alternately.
The user then has to select a corresponding label in the drop down menu which has the same theme as the picture.
If the user clicks on the 'Evaluate' button the picture is being put in a folder which has the same name as the label.

The program might be useful when pictures are being imported from a camera or smartphone thus providing a more structured environment. 
The user can then sort pictures according to the event e.g. "Birthday", "Vacation in Italy", "Graduation", etc, which are being automatically put in a folder.

Please be aware that the pyqt5_gui.py-file has to be located in the same directory where the pictures to be classified are located.
