# Small PyQt5 GUI for Sorting Pictures
This program creates a GUI where pictures and dropdown-menus are displayed alternately.
The user then has to find a corresponding label to the picture.
If the user clicks on the 'Evaluate' button pictures are being put in a folder which has the same name as the label.

The program might be useful, when pictures are being imported from a camera or smartphone and provides a more structured environment. 
The user can then sort pictures according to the event e.g. "Birthday", "Vacation in Italy", "Graduation", etc.
